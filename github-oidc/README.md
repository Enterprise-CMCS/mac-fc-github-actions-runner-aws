# github-oidc module

This module is DEPRECATED.

Use the official AWS OIDC role and identity provider modules. See [the confluence page for setting up a self-hosted runner](https://confluenceent.cms.gov/x/-Nj_Fw) for more information.

The rest of this README is useful for understanding how AWS trusts the GitHub Action Open ID Connect Identity (OIDC) Provider (IdP).

This folder contains two methods for using infrastructure-as-code (IaC) to create the resources necessary to use GitHub's OIDC provider to retrieve short-term credentials for performing AWS actions in a GitHub Actions workflow.

- [Terraform](./terraform/) <=========================> DEPRECATED
- [Cloudformation](./cloudformation)

The advantage of using the GitHub OIDC with the AWS identity provider resource is that there is no need to create an IAM user and store long-term AWS credentials in GitHub secrets.

## Resources

Note: In order to successfully create IAM resources in CMS Cloud, developers must supply a path and permissions boundary for the resources. The path and permission boundary vaules defined in [this documentation](https://cloud.cms.gov/creating-identity-access-management-policies) are set automatically via IaC.

### IAM OIDC Identity Provider

An IAM OIDC identity provider is a resource in IAM that describes an external identity provider (IdP) service that supports the [OpenID Connect (OIDC) standard](http://openid.net/connect/). The AWS identity provider resource is configured with the URL (`token.actions.githubusercontent.com`) and server certificate thumbprint of the GitHub OIDC provider. A valid default value for the thumbprint is provided, but thumbprint can also be obtained by following [these steps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc_verify-thumbprint.html).

NOTE: AWS secures communication with the GitHub IdP through its library of trusted root certificate authorities (CAs) instead of using a certificate thumbprint to verify GitHub's IdP server certificate. The thumbprint remains in the AWS identity provider configuration, but is no longer used for validation. source: [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers_create_oidc_verify-thumbprint.html)

## IAM Role

This is the role that the Actions workflow assumes via the OIDC request. The permissions defined for this role dictate the scope of the short-term credentials that are generated and passed back to GitHub by AWS. The ARN of this role is output by each of the IaC methods listed, and is passed in to the [GitHub Action that configures AWS credentials for workflows](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#assuming-a-role). See the example below under "Using the OIDC Provider in a Workflow."

### IAM Trust Policy

This policy establishes the trust relationship between GitHub OIDC IdP and the AWS OIDC identity provider resource based on values in the JSON web token (JWT) submitted by the GitHub OIDC IdP. Here's an example of the JWT sent by GitHub to AWS:

```json
{
  "typ": "JWT",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "x5t": "example-thumbprint",
  "kid": "example-key-id"
}
{
  "jti": "2e624367-5ab9-4133-c537-861d1b19a85b",
  "sub": "repo:{organization}/{repo}:ref:refs/heads/{branch}",
  "aud": "sts.amazonaws.com",
  "ref": "refs/heads/{branch}",
  "sha": "ec7d38be2362bfaaf8878a1cebb4b0f695eab764",
  "repository": "{organization}/{repo}",
  "repository_owner": "{organization}",
  "repository_owner_id": "3209407",
  "run_id": "3339113236",
  "run_number": "117",
  "run_attempt": "3",
  "repository_visibility": "public",
  "repository_id": "376113068",
  "actor_id": "25254258",
  "actor": "{github username}",
  "workflow": "{workflow name}",
  "head_ref": "",
  "base_ref": "",
  "event_name": "push",
  "ref_type": "branch",
  "job_workflow_ref": "{organization}/{repo}/.github/workflows/{workflow name}.yml@refs/heads/{branch}",
  "enterprise": "centers-for-medicare-medicaid-services",
  "iss": "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com ",
  "nbf": 1666887165,
  "exp": 1666888065,
  "iat": 1666887765
}
```

The trust policy verifies claims in the JWT based on the following inputs:

#### Subject Claim (sub)

Subject claims allow you to configure the GitHub branch or environment that is permitted to perform AWS actions via the OIDC provider. [Read more about subject claims](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#example-subject-claims)

#### Audience Claim (aud)

The principal sending the JWT needs to identify itself using the audience claim. The default for this value is set to `sts.amazonaws.com`, which is the [value used by the AWS credentials GitHub Action](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials#assuming-a-role) that we recommend you use with these resources.

### IAM Permissions Policy

This external policy is grants permissions to perform AWS actions in the workflow. For example, if the workflow is scaling self-hosted runners in ECS or importing findings to Security Hub, a policy granting those permissions would need to be attached to the role that the AWS OIDC provider federates to upon validating the JWT from the GitHub OIDC provider.

### Using the OIDC Provider in a Workflow

Note that the `id-token: write` permission is [required to authorize the request for the GitHub OIDC token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#adding-permissions-settings). You can set the permission globally, or per job. If you forget this step, you will see the error `Error: Credentials could not be loaded, please check your action inputs: Could not load credentials from any providers`.

```yml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1
        with:
          aws-region: us-east-1
          role-to-assume: ${ARN of the role created by this module}
     ...
```
